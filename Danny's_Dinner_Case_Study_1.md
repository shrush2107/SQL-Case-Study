## Business Task
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they‚Äôve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!

## Question and Solution

### Creating the schema:
````sql
CREATE SCHEMA dannys_diner;
use dannys_diner;

CREATE TABLE sales (
  customer_id VARCHAR(1),
  order_date DATE,
  product_id INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO sales
  (customer_id, order_date, product_id)
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '1'),
  ('A', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-07', '2'),
  ('A', '2021-01-10', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('A', '2021-01-11', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-01-01', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-02', '2'),
  ('B', '2021-01-04', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-11', '1'),
  ('B', '2021-01-16', '3'),
  ('B', '2021-02-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-01', '3'),
  ('C', '2021-01-07', '3');
 

CREATE TABLE menu (
  product_id INTEGER,
  product_name VARCHAR(5),
  price INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO menu
  (product_id, product_name, price)
VALUES
  ('1', 'sushi', '10'),
  ('2', 'curry', '15'),
  ('3', 'ramen', '12');
  

CREATE TABLE members (
  customer_id VARCHAR(1),
  join_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO members
  (customer_id, join_date)
VALUES
  ('A', '2021-01-07'),
  ('B', '2021-01-09');
````


### 1.What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
````sql 
SELECT 
    customer_id, CONCAT('$ ', SUM(price)) AS total_spend
FROM
    sales
        JOIN
    menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id;
````
STEPS:
- The query joins the sales table with the menu table on the product_id.
- It groups the results by customer_id.
- It calculates the total amount spent for each customer.
- The CONCAT('$ ', SUM(price)) concatenates the dollar sign with the sum of prices for each customer.

### 2.How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
````sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT (order_date)) AS total_visits
FROM
    sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
````
STEPS:
- To determine the unique number of visits for each customer, utilize COUNT(DISTINCT `order_date`).
- Remember to include the DISTINCT keyword to ensure accurate counting, preventing duplicate inclusion of days. Without DISTINCT, multiple visits on the same day, like Customer A's two visits on '2021-01-07', would incorrectly inflate the count to 2 days instead of the correct count of 1 day.


### 3.What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
````sql
WITH temp AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id, order_date, product_name, 
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS purchase_rank 
    FROM 
        sales 
        JOIN 
        menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
)
SELECT 
    customer_id, product_name 
FROM 
    temp 
WHERE 
    purchase_rank = 1;
````
STEPS:
- Create a temporary table temp using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named temp.
- Within the temp table, select columns customer_id, order_date, product_name, and calculates a ranking for each purchase made by a customer (purchase_rank). The DENSE_RANK() function is used, which assigns a rank to each row within a partition of the result set. Here, the partition is defined by the customer_id, and the rows are ordered by order_date.
- The sales table is joined with the menu table based on the product_id to obtain the product_name.
- Once the temp table is created, the main query selects customer_id and product_name from the temp table where the purchase_rank is equal to 1. This means it selects the first purchase made by each customer, as determined by the ordering of order_date.

### 4.What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
````sql
SELECT 
    product_name, COUNT(menu.product_id) AS purchase_count
FROM
    sales
        JOIN
    menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.product_id
ORDER BY purchase_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
````
STEPS:
- Perform a COUNT aggregation on the product_id column and ORDER BY the result in descending order using purchase_count field.
- Apply the LIMIT 1 clause to filter and retrieve the highest number of purchased items.

### 5.Which item was the most popular for each customer?
````sql
WITH customer_popular AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id, product_name, COUNT(product_name) AS quantity_purchased 
    FROM 
        sales 
    JOIN 
        menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id 
    GROUP BY 
        customer_id , product_name
)
SELECT 
    customer_id, product_name, quantity_purchased 
FROM 
    (
        SELECT 
            customer_id, product_name, quantity_purchased, 
            DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY quantity_purchased DESC) AS popular_ranking 
        FROM 
            customer_popular
    ) AS popular_for_customer 
WHERE 
    popular_ranking = 1;
````
STEPS:
- A Common Table Expression (CTE) named customer_popular is created to calculate how many times each customer purchased each item.
- The CTE joins the sales table with the menu table using product_id, then groups the data by customer_id and product_name to count the number of purchases.
- In the main query, the DENSE_RANK() window function is used to assign a ranking to each item per customer based on purchase count, in descending order.
- The outer query filters to only include items with the top rank (popular_ranking = 1) ‚Äî representing the most frequently purchased item(s) for each customer.

### 6.Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
````sql
WITH temp AS (
    SELECT 
        sales.customer_id, order_date, product_id, join_date, 
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS order_rank
    FROM 
        sales 
    JOIN 
        members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id 
    WHERE 
        sales.order_date > members.join_date
)
SELECT 
    customer_id, product_name 
FROM 
    temp 
JOIN 
    menu ON temp.product_id = menu.product_id 
WHERE 
    order_rank = '1';
````
STEPS:
- A Common Table Expression (CTE) named temp is created to identify orders made by each customer after their membership start date.
- The CTE joins the sales table with the members table using customer_id and filters out any orders that occurred on or before the membership join date.
- The DENSE_RANK() window function is used to rank each customer's qualifying orders based on the order date, with the earliest order assigned rank 1.
- The main query joins the temp CTE with the menu table on product_id to retrieve the corresponding product name.
- The final result filters only those rows where the order_rank is 1, representing the first item purchased by each customer after becoming a member.

### 7.Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
````sql
WITH temp AS (
    SELECT 
        sales.customer_id, order_date, product_id, join_date, 
        DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS order_rank
    FROM 
        sales 
    JOIN 
        members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id 
    WHERE 
        sales.order_date < members.join_date
)
SELECT 
    customer_id, product_name 
FROM 
    temp 
JOIN 
    menu ON temp.product_id = menu.product_id 
WHERE 
    order_rank = '1';
````
STEPS:
- A Common Table Expression (CTE) named temp is used to find purchases made by each customer before they became a member.
- The CTE joins the sales table with the members table on customer_id and filters for orders where order_date is earlier than the join_date.
- The DENSE_RANK() window function is applied to assign a rank to each qualifying order per customer, ordered by order_date in descending order ‚Äî so the most recent pre-membership order gets rank 1.
- The main query joins the temp CTE with the menu table using product_id to retrieve the product name.
- The final WHERE clause filters for rows where order_rank = 1, giving the last item purchased by each customer before becoming a member.


### 8.What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
````sql
SELECT 
    sales.customer_id,
    COUNT(order_date) AS total_items,
    SUM(price) AS total_amount
FROM
    sales
        JOIN
    members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id
        JOIN
    menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
WHERE
    sales.order_date < members.join_date
GROUP BY sales.customer_id
ORDER BY sales.customer_id;
````
STEPS:
- The query joins three tables: sales, members, and menu.
sales is joined with members on customer_id to get membership details.
sales is joined with menu on product_id to get item prices.
- The WHERE clause filters for purchases made before the customer‚Äôs membership start date (order_date < join_date).
- The result is grouped by customer_id to compute per-customer totals.
- COUNT(order_date) counts how many items (orders) each customer made before becoming a member.
- SUM(price) adds up the total spending for those items. The final output is ordered by customer_id.

###  9.If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
````sql
WITH customerPoints AS (SELECT 
    customer_id,
    product_name,
    price,
    CASE
        WHEN product_name = 'sushi' THEN price * 10 * 2
        ELSE price * 10
    END AS points
FROM
    sales
        JOIN
    menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id)
SELECT 
    customer_id, SUM(points) AS total_points
FROM
    customerPoints
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
````

STEPS:
- A Common Table Expression (CTE) named customerPoints is created to calculate reward points for each item purchased by every customer.
- The sales table is joined with the menu table using product_id to get the product name and price.
- A CASE statement is used to calculate points: For sushi, the points are price √ó 10 √ó 2 (double points).For all other items, the points are price √ó 10.
- The main query aggregates the total points earned by each customer using SUM(points).
- The results are grouped by customer_id and ordered in ascending order.

### 10.In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
````sql
WITH dates_cte AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id, 
      join_date, 
      join_date + 6 AS valid_date, 
      DATE_TRUNC(
        'month', '2021-01-31'::DATE)
        + interval '1 month' 
        - interval '1 day' AS last_date
  FROM members
)

SELECT 
  sales.customer_id, 
  SUM(CASE
    WHEN menu.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * menu.price
    WHEN sales.order_date BETWEEN dates.join_date AND dates.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * menu.price
    ELSE 10 * menu.price END) AS points
FROM sales
INNER JOIN dates_cte AS dates
  ON sales.customer_id = dates.customer_id
  AND dates.join_date <= sales.order_date
  AND sales.order_date <= dates.last_date
INNER JOIN menu
  ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.customer_id;
````
STEPS:
- A Common Table Expression (CTE) named dates_cte is created: It defines a valid points period of 7 days (join_date to join_date + 6). It also calculates the last valid date of the dataset as the last day of January 2021 using DATE_TRUNC and interval arithmetic.
- The main query joins sales with dates_cte on customer_id, filtering sales to be within the membership period and the month. It also joins with menu using product_id to retrieve product prices.
- A CASE statement is used to assign points: Sushi earns double points always (2 √ó 10 √ó price). Other items earn double points if purchased within 7 days of joining. All other purchases earn regular points (10 √ó price).
- The points are aggregated (SUM) per customer and grouped accordingly.


### 11. Recreate the table with: customer_id, order_date, product_name, price, member (Y/N)
````sql
SELECT 
    sales.customer_id, 
    sales.order_date, 
    menu.product_name, 
    menu.price,
    CASE
        WHEN sales.order_date >= members.join_date THEN 'Y'
        ELSE 'N'
    END AS member
FROM 
    sales 
JOIN 
    menu ON sales.product_id = menu.product_id 
LEFT JOIN 
    members ON sales.customer_id = members.customer_id 
ORDER BY 
    sales.customer_id, 
    sales.order_date;
````
STEPS:
- The query joins the sales table with the menu table using product_id to get the product details.
- A LEFT JOIN is used to bring in join_date from the members table for each customer_id. This ensures that all sales are included even if a customer never became a member.
- A CASE statement is used to determine the membership status at the time of each purchase: If the order_date is on or after the join_date, the customer is marked as a member ('Y'). Otherwise, they are marked as not a member ('N').
- The results are ordered by customer_id and order_date to show each customer‚Äôs purchase history chronologically with membership status.
